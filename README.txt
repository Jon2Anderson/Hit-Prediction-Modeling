This script uses the MLB Savant statcast data set to predict whether a batted ball will go for a hit or not based on three inputs:

1. Velocity of the batted ball
2. Launch angle of the batted ball
3. Direction of the batted ball.

I used the Random Forest algorithm and achieved an 88% accuracy rate in prediction.
